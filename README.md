Optimus
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pesos/optimus.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pesos/optimus)

Optimus is a P.R.I.M.E. (Pseudo Robotic Irc Messaging Entity). He is being developed to monitor the logs and provide assistance in [PES OpenSource Community](pesos.pes.edu)'s IRC channel [#pes-os](http://pesos.pes.edu/irc) (in freenode)

The attempt here is to write an IRC bot, but at the same time try to give it a personality, that of the character [Optimus Prime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime) in [Transformers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers) series  

###Installation
1. Clone the repository and change to the project directory
2. Run ```npm install```. Of course, you need to have [Nodejs](http://nodejs.org/download) first.
3. Run ```npm start```. The bot will have connected to the set channels and started logging. The configurations can be tweaked in ```config.js```

###Running tests
Execute ```npm test``` in the project directory.
